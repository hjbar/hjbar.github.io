I am currently a second-year student in the <a href="https://mpri-master.ens.fr/">Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">École Polytechnique</a>. I previously completed a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/">Université Paris-Saclay</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I enjoy functional programming, especially coding in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">OCaml</a>. I am interested in programming language theory and logic. I particularly appreciate theory that can be applied in practice.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I enjoy sports, especially judo and football. I am also interested in chess. In my free time, I play a bit of video games and listen to music, mainly rap.
